# how the tool works

this tool can detect technologies of web applications and can even detect cms without forgetting their versions 
this tool is built with golang reputer for it's speed
we can analyze a single url or a file that contains several urls
the result in the terminal is made in the form of tables for easy reading; in parallel a file.xlsx is created and saves the same results as the terminal[passeport.pdf](https://github.com/imad-de/imad-de-imad-de-Renovate-a-tool-to-identify-the-technologies-behind-large-scale-web-applications/files/8990801/passeport.pdf)
